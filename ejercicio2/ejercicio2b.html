          <h3>ELLIOT</h3>
          <p>As a senior network technician for cyber security firm Allsafe, Elliot protects corporate clients — including the ubiquitous Evil Corp — from security breaches and data theft. As a vigilante hacker, he monitors the people in his daily life and protects those he’s close to from their own flaws, sometimes with unpredictable results.</p>

          <h3>DARLENE</h3>
            <p>Darlene is a malware coder whose skills are fundamental to fsociety’s master plan. Though biting and jaded, she becomes Elliot’s confidante. He relies on her resilience and creativity for quick problem solving and fast hacks. She is an excellent lock picker, a crass jokester and a jobless transient.</p>

          <h3>MR.ROBOT</h3>
          <p>A mysterious figure who approaches Elliot with the opportunity to contribute to a worldwide revolution, Mr. Robot has a murky history but huge plans for the future. He recruits the members of fsociety to come together at the abandoned arcade -- and is relentless in his leadership of the team.</p>

          <h3>ANGELA</h3>
            <p>As an Allsafe account executive, Angela has over five years of marketing innovation experience with hands-on knowledge of go-to-market routes, business strategy and the ability to connect marketing to sales growth. She is ambitious but lacks confidence, savvy but lacks technological skills.</p>
